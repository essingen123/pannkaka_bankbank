# Note: Using dconf instead of gsettings to set custom keybindings
# Reason: The schema /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys.custom-keybindings was not found when using gsettings
# Solution: Switching to dconf and using the correct schema and key paths fixed the issue

# Non-working examples:
# NOOoooo WRONG: TOGGLE_KEY = "<Ctrl>p"DONT YOU DARE
# NOOoooo WRONG: CTIVATE_KEY = "<Meta>P"DONT YOU DARE
# NOOoooo WRONG:TOGGLE_KEY = "Alt+P" DONT YOU DARE

# Working example in xpanik_button_cooler_THIS_ONE_WORKS.txt
Shit like this should work:

dconf
write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/binding 
"'<Primary><Super><Alt>space'"
 && 
dconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/command "'/usr/bin/notify-send Yayayay; '";

IN OTHER WORDS:
TOGGLE_KEY = "\"'<Primary><Super><Alt>space'\""
DEACTIVATE_KEY = "\"'<Primary><Super><Alt>p'\""
ACTIVATE_KEY = "\"'<Primary><Super><Alt>o'\""


et up custom keybindings keys MUST HAVE NESTED QUOTING!!!!!!!!! "'<Alt>o" G#LO"
